# ABC Graph Distance Stuff!

Project concept: How do different graph distance measures affect our ABC (Approximate Bayesian Compoutation) estimates of parameter posteriors for network growth models with intractable likelihoods? 

General organizational tips:

(1) Make sure to start off by adding your own branch using ```git checkout -b MyName_branch```, and push this to the master repo using ```git push origin MyName_branch```.

(2) Commit and push all further changes to your own branch, from which you can merge changes to the master repo on Github using a pull request. You can check which branch you're on using ```git branch```, and the initial push to your branch should be done using ```git push --set-upstream origin MyName_branch```.   

(3) Update your branch to avoid conflicts using ```git pull origin master ```. 

(4) Add any ipython notebooks to the ```ipython_notebooks``` folder, and organize other code into aptly-named folders.

Let's explore and do fun science!
