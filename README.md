# ABC Graph Distance Stuff!

Project concept: How do different graph distance measures affect our ABC (Approximate Bayesian Compoutation) estimates of parameter posteriors for network growth models with intractable likelihoods? 

Make sure to start off by adding your own branch using ```git checkout -b MyName_branch```, and push this to the master repo using ```git push origin MyName_branch```. Commit and push all changes to your own branch (you can check which branch you're on using ```git branch```), from which you can merge changes to the master repo on Github. Update your branch to avoid conflicts using ```git pull origin master ```. 

For easier  organization, add any ipython notebooks to the ```ipython_notebooks``` folder. Otherwise, let's explore and do fun science!
